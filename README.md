# bubbles
##A bubble popping game.
Pop the green bubbles before they pop by themselves, be quick, if they are too large you don't get any points.

Written in vanlla javascript, no frameworks or ajax libraries in sight.
Uses HTML Canvas for rendering.

## Graphics Demo
I expanded on my original graphical demo using offscreen rendering. Works both with touch input and mouse clicks.
Demo is now semi gamified.

###TODO:
* Implement loose condition
* Implement harder to score as levels progress
* Implement user input own name
* Implement user selectable levels of difficulty
* Implement saving
* Implement "Mission Mode"
