# bubbles
##A bubble popping game.
Pop the green bubbles before they pop by themselves, be quick, if they are too large you don't get any points.

## Graphics Demo
I expanded on my original graphical demo using offscreen rendering. Works both with touch input and mouse clicks.
Demo is now semi gamified.

###TODO:
*Implement loose condition
*Implement harder to score as levels progress
*Implement user input own name
*Implement user selectable levels of difficulty
*Implement saving
*Implement "Mission Mode"
